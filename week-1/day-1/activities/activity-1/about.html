    <h1>About Me</h1>  
    <p> My name is Ahmar. I'm from Manchester and have lived here for most of my life. 
        I'm married and have 3 kids. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I like computer technology and doing DIY. I'm also interested in watching and playing sports like football and cricket.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm hoping to use the knowledge gained on this course to help me eventually get a career in coding.
