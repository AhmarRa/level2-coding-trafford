# Challenge 6

# Create two variables called num1 and num2.
# Create an if statement that checks if the result of the sum is
# even.
# If it is, return a success message.

num1 = 11
num2 = 18

if (num1 + num2) % 2 == 0:
    print("Success, the sum of the two numbers is even")
else:
    print("Nope, the sum of the two numbers is not even")
