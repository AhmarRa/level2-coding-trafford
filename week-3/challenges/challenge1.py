# Create a for loop that prints “hello world” 13 times.
# Now, convert this into a while loop that does the same job.

# for i in range(1,14):
#     print(f'{i}. Hello World')

for i in range(0,13):
    print(f'Hello World')

# counter = 0
# while counter < 13:
#    print(f'{counter+1}. Hello World')
#    counter += 1
